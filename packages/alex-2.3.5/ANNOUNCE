I am pleased to announce version 2.3 of Alex, the lexical analyser
generator for Haskell.

Changes in Alex 2.3 vs. 2.2:

  * monadUserState wrapper (Alain Cremieux)
  * Efficient lexing of strict ByteStrings (Don Stewart)
  * Works with Cabal 1.2, 1.4 & 1.6

Distributions can be obtained from Alex's home page:
